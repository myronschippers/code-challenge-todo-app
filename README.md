## Overview

For this challenge I will be using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the Front-end framework which will take care of the server and React front-end.

- [Code Challenge Brief](./README_BRIEF.md)

## The Challenge

The code challenge is to build out a todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Additional details can be found in the [Challenge Brief](./design/README_BRIEF.md).

> NOTE: *Open Note/Open Book*, Any tools are allowed to assist in completion of the challenge. This includes build tools, frameworks, and libraries.

**Application Requirements:**

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size (responsive application)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## Dev Process

Takeaways from the active development of the project.

### Built With

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

#### Getting Started

1. run `npx create-next-app@latest`
    - make all selections needed
    - Yes to Typescript on the project
    - No to Tailwind for styling

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

#### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
